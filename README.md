I am most excited for learning about the efficiency of code. I have been writing programs in my previous classes, but have never actually taken the time to think about how time/space efficient the code is. I am excited to learn the different data strucutures and alogrithms used to improve my code. I feel like that is a very crucial topic to understand when going into the field. I have heard from peers that this is the most important class in computer science, which makes me very excited for it.
